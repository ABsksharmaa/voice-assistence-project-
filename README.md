This is a Python-based voice assistant that performs basic tasks through voice commands. It can open websites like YouTube or Google, tell jokes, and answer general knowledge questions using Wikipedia. It also integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT to handle complex queries. The assistant listens to voice input, processes commands, and replies using text-to-speech, enabling a hands-free user experience with natural conversation flow.
